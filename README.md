# NLP-ChatbotProject

Chatbots are dialog engine systems built using NLP pipelines that are designed to have human-like conversations. Usually, they are developed to successfully carry out redundant and repetitive conversational tasks which don’t require human intervention. However, complex bots nowadays can mimic human characteristics and do complex tasks like interpreting the world for people with compromised vision.

DIALOGFLOW vs GENERATIVE CHATBOT :

From the research and analysis, it was found out that software like Dialogflow is more beneficial for beginners or users with no coding experience, as it has a GUI that allows the users to design a chatbot with minimal coding. It provides a low-code environment that gets you started quickly. Generative chatbots, on the other hand, have to be coded entirely and are for experienced users to build intelligent AI chatbots.

It was also noticed that building a chatbot using the seq2seq model provides more flexibility in terms of choosing a corpus, training methods, or ML models to be used. But when it comes to Dialogflow, it is more like a black box with regards to model training because the end-user cannot customize the training methods used.

However,  when training the chatbots built using deep learning models, it was discovered that it is tremendously taxing on the resources as they require a good GPU. It requires tons of data and processing power to build an adequately generative chatbot. But Dialogflow is much faster and more scalable. Since it is a service that is hosted on the cloud, there’s no dependency on the user’s machine. And even though the processing power of the machines has increased significantly, it may not be enough for each potential user to build an intelligent agent using their local resources.
